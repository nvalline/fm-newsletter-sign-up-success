## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Regular Expression (RegEx)

### What I learned

For this challenge I learned how to verify form data without using a library. Even though this is a basic form, I feel the underlying concepts will carry over to more complex forms.

### Continued development

I would like to better learn regular expressions so that they are not so foreign or intimidating to use.
